# STM32 Projects

This repository contains various STM32CubeIDE projects demonstrating different functionalities using the STM32 microcontroller. Each project builds upon previous ones to showcase the capabilities of GPIO, interrupts, USART communication, I2C, timers, PWM, and more.

## Project 1: Light

**Description**: Utilize GPIO pins to configure red, green, and blue LEDs to create a breathing light effect by transitioning between colors.

## Project 2: Button Light

**Description**: Use GPIO to read two buttons to control the LEDs. The buttons can toggle the lights on and off and switch between different colors.

## Project 3: Interrupt Light

**Description**: Based on Project 2, implement an interrupt on a specified red LED that blinks at a fixed delay. Use button interrupts to control the toggling of a green LED.

## Project 4: Serial Communication

**Description**: Use USART to transmit commands that control the LEDs to turn on or off specific colors
